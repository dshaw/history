    ==================

      * Added support for markdown. (@dshaw)

## Commands

    `history` - prints help.
    `history version` - view current project version.
    `history {version}` - creates/updates History.md interactively, sets package.json version.
    `history view` - view entire history.

    `history -v` - view history version number.

## Dammit, I want to use `HISTORY`, not `History.md`

    HIST_FILENAME=HISTORY hist [command]

## Obligatory meta

Yes, I used `history` to write history's history file.
